# Foocu Goals

These are goals to help the project keep moving forward.
Every commit should be progress toward the current goal.

    Current goal: Decent map rendering

## Decent map rendering

### Started: 123.2013

(I actually started this goal earlier, but I don't know what to count as
the start date now.)

For now, treat the map as a height function. So there is no going under stuff
or into caves, for example.

The rendering and motion should make it visually clear which things are higher
than others. I won't worry about transparency yet.

## Improve random map generation

Specifically, break things down into a small number of biomes, add new sprites
for them, and display those. Another step will be to alter the heights based on
the biomes. More details are pending once I get to this point.
