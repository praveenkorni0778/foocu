# Foocu

The vision of foocu is to be old-school Zelda-ish game.
For now it is a sprite of a guy walking around a rather boring map.
Here's what we've got so far:

This is not a serious project, and is mostly coding for fun.
It's based on the 2d game engine [Love](https://love2d.org/).

Just in case for some weird reason anyone else besides me
ever looks at this, please take your lowest expectations and
cut them in half. This is basically scratch work that I
decided to make public because why not.

## Installation and running

Git clone this repo, install [Love](https://love2d.org/), and type:

    love game

In case you get "command not found," see
[this love2d.ord page](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Mac_OSX)
for info on running love games from
the command line. (It's fine to load it via GUI; I just like running it
from the command line.)
